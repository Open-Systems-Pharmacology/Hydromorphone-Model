# Hydromorphone-Model
**_The whole-body PBPK model for hydromorphone, an opioid analgesic and UGT2B7 substrate._**

## Repository files
**_Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of hydromorphone, whose in vivo clearance is relied on glucuronidation and to a lesser extent renal excretion. The model was assessed using observed data on hydromorphone pharmacokinetics with various dosing protocols. The detailed information on model development and evaluation was described in [1]._**
